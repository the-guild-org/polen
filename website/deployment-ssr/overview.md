# Deployment (SSR)

Polen can generate a traditional serverful app (NodeJS).

The app will run server side rendering (SSR) so that your website has good SEO and performance characteristics.

In the future Polen will have serverful features like user context integration. Currently however there are no particular features. For this reason we generally recommend using the [SSG Polen build architecture](/deployment-ssg/overview) which gives you more deployment options and runtime performance.
