# Home Page

Polen can automatically generate a home page for your GraphQL developer portal.

## Overview

The home page is structured as a series of sections that work together to get your users going on their projects effeciently.

Each section is configurable but with sensible defaults that are often driven by project conventions like the presence of key files. Polen maximizes automation without blocking you from escaping into a custom setup.

## Hero Section
