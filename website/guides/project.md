# Project

### Authors

Polen is created and maintained by [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev), a group of open source developers behind many popular GraphQL tools. Development is currently being led by [Jason Kuhrt](https://github.com/jasonkuhrt).

### Stability

Polen is still in early days under active initial development. It can be considered alpha-level stability and quality.

Early adopters who want to help shape Polen with us are welcome! Those looking for absolute stability should wait for a 1.0 release this or next year for their production deployments (but meanwhile do try it out and give feedback if you can!).

### Releases

We maintain the following dist tags on the npm registry:

- `latest` - The latest stable release
- `next` - The latest preview release. Every commit to trunk triggers a new release to this dist tag. You can always find the pending changelog for the next release [here](https://github.com/the-guild-org/polen/releases/tag/next).

We aim to cut a stable release every Thursday.

### Changelog

We maintain a changelog using GitHub releases [on our repo](https://github.com/the-guild-org/polen/releases).

### License

Polen is open source software released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/the-guild-org/polen/blob/main/LICENSE).
