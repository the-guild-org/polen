# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for Polen.

## Workflows

### deploy-demos.yml

Deploys the Polen demo sites to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

**Features:**

- Builds both Pokemon and GitHub example demos
- Creates an index page listing all demos
- Deploys to GitHub Pages on main branch pushes
- Skips deployment for pull requests (build only)

**URL:** The demos will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`

### deploy-preview.yml

Creates preview deployments for pull requests using GitHub Pages sub-directories.

**Features:**

- Builds demos for every pull request
- Deploys to a unique GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `/pr-123/`)
- Comments on the PR with the preview URL
- Updates the deployment on new commits
- Automatically cleans up when PR is closed
- Creates an index page listing all active PR previews

**No additional secrets required** - uses the same GitHub Pages setup as the main deployment

## Setup Instructions

### GitHub Pages Setup

1. Go to Settings â†’ Pages in your GitHub repository
2. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
3. The workflow will automatically deploy on the next push to main

### PR Preview Setup

PR previews use the same GitHub Pages setup as the main deployment. They will be automatically deployed to sub-directories like:
- `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/pr-123/`
- `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/pr-124/`

An index page at `/pr-index.html` lists all active PR previews.
