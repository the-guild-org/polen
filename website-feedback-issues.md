# Polen Website Feedback Issues

_Based on Jeff's feedback - July 11, 2025_

## Quick Wins (Obviously Do This)

### Issue 1: Add screenshots to Schema Reference and Schema Changelog sections

**Jeff's feedback:** "And once built out, screenshots in the 'schema reference', and 'schema changelog' will go a long way to helping showcase what this tool can do"

**Action:** Add visual examples showing what these features produce

---

### Issue 2: Simplify GitHub Pages deployment documentation

**Jeff's feedback:** "We should put a workflow/action on the Github community actions page to simplify this even further"

**Action:** Create and publish a GitHub Action for easier Polen deployment

---

## Needs Discussion (Strategic Decisions)

### Issue 3: Schema Augmentations feature - Remove or defer

**Jeff's feedback:** "Is this feature built out?? I think this could be a phase 2 feature. It seems contradictory to the intended automation/self governance based approach. Consider removing for now."

**Decision needed:** Should we remove this feature from the website until it's fully built?

---

### Issue 4: Homepage feature boxes reorganization

**Jeff's feedback:**

- "Basically I think these boxes cover different concepts."
- "I'd consider dividing it into 2 sections -- one with the paragraphs about what this tool does at its core, and the next can be these boxes highlighting some of the important features"

**Decision needed:** How to restructure the homepage to separate core value prop from feature highlights

---

### Issue 5: "Context" box on homepage

**Jeff's feedback:** "And you could probably remove the 'context' box. It's a bit confusing unless you're very technical. I think it's better highlighted further into the docs."

**Decision needed:** Move technical "context" information deeper into documentation

---

### Issue 6: Navigation structure - Customization section

**Jeff's feedback:** "I'd keep these two separate by nesting 'Pages', 'Logo', and 'Configuration' underneath a 'Customization' section."

**Decision needed:** Restructure navigation to have clearer hierarchy

---

### Issue 7: Why Polen page improvements

**Jeff's feedback:**

- "All of this is interesting information but I dont think most people will care and it is a lot of content for people to read."
- "I think the background info could be a separate page that is at the very bottom of the nav bar."
- "And for the features, I wonder if there's ways we can show people what it does and why it's important vs telling them."

**Decision needed:**

- Move background info to separate page
- Show features visually instead of text-heavy explanations

---

### Issue 8: Consider video content

**Jeff's feedback:** "Maybe in the long term, having a number of short videos showcasing how these different aspects play a role?"

**Decision needed:** Long-term content strategy for video demonstrations

---

## Summary

1. Add screenshots to Schema Reference and Schema Changelog
2. Create GitHub Action for deployment
