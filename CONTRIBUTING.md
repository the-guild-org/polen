# Contributing to Polen

Welcome to Polen! We're excited that you're interested in contributing. This guide covers the social and collaboration aspects of contributing to our project. For technical setup and development details, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Before You Begin

### Start with Discussion

For any significant changes, please open an issue first to discuss your proposal. This helps:

- Align on technical design before implementation
- Avoid duplicate work
- Ensure your contribution fits the project's direction

Small bug fixes and documentation improvements can be submitted directly as PRs.

### Communication Guidelines

- **Be respectful and constructive** in all interactions
- **Ask questions** when you're unsure - we're here to help
