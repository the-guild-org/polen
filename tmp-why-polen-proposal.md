# "Why Polen" Page Restructuring Proposal

## Jeff's Feedback

- Too much content that most people won't care about
- Background info should be separate page at bottom of nav
- Show features visually instead of telling

## Proposed Structure

### Main "Why Polen" Page (Focused & Visual)

```markdown
# Why Polen?

## See Your GraphQL API Come to Life

### New "About Polen" Page (Technical Background)

Move all the technical/philosophical content to a separate page:

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Main page is scannable** - Visual elements and bullet points instead of paragraphs

4. **Action-oriented** - Clear next steps
