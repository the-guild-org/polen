# Member Management via the GraphQL API

Organization members, roles, and invites can be managed via the GraphQL API. For more information,
please refer to our
[member and permissions documentation](/docs/management/members-roles-permissions).

## Retrieve List of Available Permissions

A list of permissions that are assignable to member roles can be retrieved via the
`Organization.availableMemberPermissionGroups` field. It returns a list of all permission groups and
their permissions.

```graphql filename="Example: Retrieve permissions by group"
query OrganizationPermissions($organizationSlug: String!) {
  organization(reference: { bySelector: { organizationSlug: $organizationSlug } }) {
    id
    slug
    availableMemberPermissionGroups {
      id
      permissions {
        id
        title
        description
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Create a Member Role

Member roles can be created using the `Mutation.createMemberRole` field.

Provide the permission ids from the `Organization.availableMemberPermissionGroups` field for the
role via the `CreateMemberRoleInput.selectedPermissions` field.

**Note:** A member role only has permissions and not resources assigned. Resources are assigned when
assigning a member role to a user.

```graphql filename="Example: Create a Member Role"
mutation CreateMemberRole($input: CreateMemberRoleInput!) {
  createMemberRole(input: $input) {
    ok {
      createdMemberRole {
        id
        name
        description
        permissions
      }
    }
    error {
      message
      inputErrors {
        name
        description
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Update a Member Role

Use the `Mutation.updateMemberRole` field for updating a member role.

```graphql filename="Example: Update Member Role"
mutation UpdatedMemberRole($input: UpdateMemberRoleInput!) {
  updateMemberRole(input: $input) {
    ok {
      updatedRole {
        id
        name
        description
        permissions
      }
    }
    error {
      message
      inputErrors {
        name
        description
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Delete a Member Role

Use the `Mutation.deleteMemberRole` field for deleting a member role.

```graphql filename="Example: Delete a Member Role"
mutation UpdatedMemberRole($input: DeleteMemberRoleInput!) {
  deleteMemberRole(input: $input) {
    ok {
      deletedMemberRoleId
    }
    error {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

## Assigning Member Roles

Use the `Mutation.assignMemberRole` field for assigning a member role to a user.

```graphql filename="Example: Assign a Member Role"
mutation AssignMemberRole($input: AssignMemberRoleInput!) {
  assignMemberRole(input: $input) {
    ok {
      updatedMember {
        role {
          id
        }
        user {
          id
        }
      }
    }
    error {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Resource Assignment

Use the `AssignMemberRoleInput.resources` field to optionally specify on which resources the
permissions granted by the role should apply. Permissions are inherited by all subresources
(organization, project, target, service, app deployment).

```json5 filename="Example: Grant permissions on all resources"
{
  mode: 'ALL',
  projects: []
}
```

```json5 filename="Example: Grant permissions on specific project"
{
  mode: 'GRANULAR',
  projects: [
    {
      projectId: '<PROJECT_ID>',
      targets: {
        // Grant permissions on all targets within project
        mode: 'ALL'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```json5 filename="Example: Grant permissions on specific target"
{
  mode: 'GRANULAR',
  projects: [
    {
      projectId: '<PROJECT_ID>',
      targets: {
        // Grant permissions on a single targets within project
        mode: 'GRANULAR',
        targets: [
          {
            targetId: '<TARGET_ID>',
            // Grant permissions on a all services within target
            services: { mode: 'ALL' },
            // Grant permissions on a all app deployments within target
            appDeployments: { mode: 'ALL' }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Retrieve list of Member Invitations

```graphql filename="Example: Member Invitations"
query Invitations($organizationSlug: String!, $after: String) {
  organization(reference: { bySelector: { organizationSlug: $organizationSlug } }) {
    invitations(first: 10, after: $after) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          email
          createdAt
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Create member invitation

Use the `Mutation.inviteToOrganizationByEmail` field for sending an email invite to the
organization.

```graphql filename="Example: Invite Members"
mutation InviteUserToOrganization($input: InviteToOrganizationByEmailInput!) {
  inviteToOrganizationByEmail(input: $input) {
    ok {
      createdOrganizationInvitation {
        id
        email
        expiresAt
      }
    }
    error {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

## Revoke member invitation

Use the `Mutation.deleteOrganizationInvitation` field for deleting an organization invitation.

```graphql
mutation DeleteOrganizationInvitation($input: DeleteOrganizationInvitationInput!) {
  deleteOrganizationInvitation(input: $input) {
    ok {
      deletedOrganizationInvitationId
    }
    error {
      message
    }
  }
}
```
