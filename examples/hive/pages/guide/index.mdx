# Using the GraphQL API

Interact programatically interact with your Hive Organization via the public Hive Console GraphQL
API. You can manage users, projects, and targets, and retrieve information about your schema usage.

The GraphQL API can be interacted with from any language that supports sending HTTP requests.

Calling the API requires a [Access Token](/docs/management/access-tokens) with the correct scopes
for the actions.

## API Basics

The Hive Console GraphQL API follows the
[GraphQL over HTTP sepcification](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/spec/GraphQLOverHTTP.md).

### Endpoint

The endpoint is [`https://api.graphql-hive.com/graphql`](https://api.graphql-hive.com/graphql). The
API comes with a GraphiQL instance for exploring and building GraphQL operations.

### Method

Requests to the GraphQL API are done with the `POST` method.

### Content Type

Requests must be encoded as JSON with the `Content-Type: application/json` header. It is recommended
to also send the `Accept: application/graphql-response+json` header.

### Authorization

Requests must be authenticated via the `Authorization` header. Provide an
[Access Token](/docs/management/access-tokens) with the correct permissions using the `Bearer`
formatting. E.g. `Authorization: Bearer hvo1/xxxxxxxxxxxxx`.

### Request Body

The request body must be a string encoded JSON object containing the following properties:

- `query` - the string representation of the Source Text of the Document as specified in the
  Language section of the GraphQL specification.
- `operationName` - an optional string
- `variables` - an optional object (map), the keys of which are the variable names and the values of
  which are the variable values

### Example Requests

Here is an example of retrieving information about your organization.

<Tabs.Root>

<Tabs.List>
<Tabs.Trigger value="javascript">JavaScript</Tabs.Trigger>
<Tabs.Trigger value="curl">curl</Tabs.Trigger>
</Tabs.List>

{/* JavaScript */}

<Tabs.Content value="javascript">

```ts
const MyOrganizationQuery = /* GraphQL */ `
  query MyOrganization($organizationSlug: String!) {
    organization(reference: { bySelector: { organizationSlug: $organizationSlug } }) {
      id
      slug
    }
  }
`

const response = await fetch('https://api.graphql-hive.com/graphql', {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    Accept: 'application/graphql-response+json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: MyOrganizationQuery,
    variables: { organizationSlug: '<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_SLUG>' }
  })
})
const body = await response.json()
```

</Tabs.Content>

{/* curl */}

<Tabs.Content value="curl">

```sh
QUERY='query MyOrganization($organizationSlug: String!) {
  organization(reference: { bySelector: { organizationSlug: $organizationSlug } }) {
    id
    slug
  }
}'
# Remove line breaks
QUERY=$(echo $QUERY | tr -d '\n')
curl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/graphql-response+json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  -X POST \
  -d '{ "query": "'"$QUERY"'", "variables": { "organizationSlug": "<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_SLUG>" } }' \
  https://api.graphql-hive.com/graphql
```

</Tabs.Content>

## Rate Limiting

The Hive Console GraphQL API uses
[Query complexity analysis](https://ibm.github.io/graphql-specs/cost-spec.html) for enforcing
rate-limiting.

We are still in the process of fine-tuning the values and limitations e.g. based on the organization
plan. If you are sending moderate and sane GraphQL operations the likely hood of being impacted by
rate-limits in the future is low.

## GraphQL Conventions

In order to provide a smooth experience the GraphQL API follows common conventions and
best-practices.

### Pagination

The GraphQL API follows the
[GraphQL Cursor Connection Specification](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm).

To paginate using cursor-based pagination in GraphQL:

1. Request the first set of items using the `first` argument (e.g., `first: 10`).
2. The response will include a `pageInfo` object with an `endCursor` and `hasNextPage`.
3. To get the next page, send a new query with the same `first` value and set `after` to the
   `endCursor` from the previous response.

Repeat this process until `hasNextPage` is `false`.

```graphql interactive
query PaginatedSchemaVersions($targetSelector: TargetSelectorInput, $first: Int!, $after: String) {
  target(reference: { bySelector: $targetSelector }) {
    id
    schemaVersions(first: $first, after: $after) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          sdl
        }
      }
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This method ensures stable pagination even if the underlying data changes (e.g. new items are
inserted).

### Mutation Fields

The GraphQL API models expected errors as part of the GraphQL schema. The type of a mutation field
is always a object type with both a `ok` and `error` property. We recommend always selecting both
fields within the mutation selection sets. In case expected mutation behaviour suceeds, the `ok`
property is non-null and contains the mutation result, while the `error` peroperty is `null`. In
case the mutation fails (e.g. due to a input validation error), the `ok` field is `null` and the
`error` field is non-null containing an error message and often additional information on the source
of the error.

```graphql interactive
mutation CreateProjectMutation($input: CreateProjectInput!) {
  createProject(input: $input) {
    ok {
      createdProject {
        id
      }
    }
    error {
      message
      # More detailed errors for each input field
      inputErrors {
        slug
      }
    }
  }
}
```
