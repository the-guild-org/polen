# Getting Started

Welcome to the Pokemon API! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## Your First Query

The simplest way to start is by fetching a single Pokemon using the `gql:Query.pokemon` field:

```graphql interactive
query GetPikachu {
  pokemon(id: "025") {
    name
    types
    stats {
      hp
      attack
      defense
      speed
    }
  }
}
```

The `gql:Pokemon` type contains all the information about a Pokemon, including its `gql:Pokemon.stats` which provides detailed battle statistics.

## Understanding Pokemon Types

Pokemon can have one or two elemental types (`gql:PokemonType` enum) that determine their strengths and weaknesses. The `gql:Pokemon.types` field returns an array of these types:

```graphql interactive
query GetTypeMatchups {
  pokemon(id: "006") {  # Charizard
    name
    types  # [FIRE, FLYING]
  }
  
  waterPokemon: pokemon(id: "009") {  # Blastoise
    name
    types  # [WATER]
  }
}
```

## Listing Pokemon

Use the `gql:Query.pokemons` query to browse Pokemon with filtering. This returns a `gql:PokemonConnection` type that supports pagination:

```graphql interactive
query ListElectricPokemon {
  pokemons(
    filter: { type: ELECTRIC }
    limit: 5
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        name
        types
        stats {
          speed
        }
      }
    }
    totalCount
  }
}
```

The `gql:PokemonConnection.edges` field contains the actual Pokemon data, while `gql:PokemonConnection.pageInfo` helps with pagination.

## Working with Trainers

Trainers catch and train Pokemon. The `gql:Trainer` type includes information about their Pokemon team via the `gql:Trainer.pokemon` field:

```graphql interactive
query GetTrainer {
  trainer(id: "ash") {
    name
    hometown
    badges
    pokemon {
      name
      level
      types
    }
  }
}
```

The `gql:Trainer.badges` field shows their achievements, while `gql:Trainer.hometown` indicates where they started their journey.

## Mutations: Catching Pokemon

If you have mutation access, you can use `gql:Mutation.catchPokemon` to add Pokemon to a trainer's team:

```graphql interactive
mutation CatchWildPokemon {
  catchPokemon(input: {
    pokemonId: "133"  # Eevee
    trainerId: "ash"
  }) {
    id
    name
    trainer {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

This mutation returns the updated `gql:Pokemon` with its new `gql:Pokemon.trainer` relationship established.

## Pagination

For large datasets, use cursor-based pagination with `gql:PageInfo`:

```graphql interactive
query PaginatedPokemon {
  pokemons(limit: 10) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        name
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
```

The `gql:PageInfo.hasNextPage` boolean tells you if more data exists, and `gql:PageInfo.endCursor` provides the cursor for the next page.
