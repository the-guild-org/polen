# Getting Started

Welcome to the Pokemon API! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## Your First Query

The simplest way to start is by fetching a single Pokemon:

```graphql interactive
query GetPikachu {
  pokemon(id: "025") {
    name
    types
    stats {
      hp
      attack
      defense
      speed
    }
  }
}
```

## Understanding Pokemon Types

Pokemon can have one or two elemental types that determine their strengths and weaknesses:

```graphql interactive
query GetTypeMatchups {
  pokemon(id: "006") {  # Charizard
    name
    types  # [FIRE, FLYING]
  }
  
  waterPokemon: pokemon(id: "009") {  # Blastoise
    name
    types  # [WATER]
  }
}
```

## Listing Pokemon

Use the `pokemons` query to browse Pokemon with filtering:

```graphql interactive
query ListElectricPokemon {
  pokemons(
    filter: { type: ELECTRIC }
    limit: 5
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        name
        types
        stats {
          speed
        }
      }
    }
    totalCount
  }
}
```

## Working with Trainers

Trainers catch and train Pokemon. Here's how to fetch trainer data:

```graphql interactive
query GetTrainer {
  trainer(id: "ash") {
    name
    hometown
    badges
    pokemon {
      name
      level
      types
    }
  }
}
```

## Mutations: Catching Pokemon

If you have mutation access, you can catch Pokemon:

```graphql interactive
mutation CatchWildPokemon {
  catchPokemon(input: {
    pokemonId: "133"  # Eevee
    trainerId: "ash"
  }) {
    id
    name
    trainer {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Pagination

For large datasets, use cursor-based pagination:

```graphql interactive
query PaginatedPokemon {
  pokemons(limit: 10) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        name
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
```
