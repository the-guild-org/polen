      elevation
    }
    facilities
  }
}
```

### Finding Trails

Get a list of all available trails:

```graphql
query GetAllTrails {
  trails {
    id
    name
    start {
      name
    }
    distanceKm
    estimatedHours
    difficulty {
      overall
    }
  }
}
```

## Weather Queries

### Current Conditions

Check the weather at a specific location:

```graphql
query GetCurrentWeather {
  getWeatherAt(placeId: "lake-louise") {
    temperature
    conditions
    windSpeedKmh
    visibility
    uvIndex
  }
}
```

    conditions
    precipitationChance
  }
}
```

## Route Planning

### Finding Routes

```graphql
query FindRoute {
  findRoute(
    startId: "moraine-lake-parking",
    endId: "sentinel-pass",
    options: {
      preferredDifficulty: MODERATE

    trails {
      name
      distanceKm
    }
    totalDistanceKm
    estimatedHours
    campgrounds {
      name
      facilities
    }
  }
}
```

### Multi-Day Trip Planning

Plan a complete multi-day adventure:

```graphql
query PlanBackpackingTrip {
  planTrip(

      conditions
      precipitationChance
    }
    recommendedGear
  }
}
```

## Trail Conditions

### Current Trail Status

Check if a trail is passable:

```graphql
query CheckTrailConditions {
  getTrailConditions(trailId: "iceline-trail") {
    status
    snowLine
    warnings
    lastUpdated
    recentReports {
      date
      conditions
      hazards
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced Queries

### Filtering by Difficulty

Find trails matching your skill level:

```graphql
query FindModerateTrails {
  trailsByDifficulty(level: MODERATE) {

    distanceKm
    difficulty {
      scrambleClass
      exposureLevel
      routeFinding
    }
    terrain
  }
}
```

### Trail Networks

Explore trail connections and branches:

```graphql
query ExploreTrailNetworks {
  trails {
    name
    trailType
    end {
      name
      type
    }
    branches {
      trail {

        }
      }
      distanceFromStart
      connectionType
    }
  }
